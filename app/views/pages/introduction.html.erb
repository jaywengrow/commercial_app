<h1>Welcome, <%= "#{current_user.name}" %>. Now, for some introductions.</h1>
		<h1>You don't have to be annyoing to advertise on the Internet. You don't have to bombard regular denizens of the World Wide Web with annoying flashing banners about credit scores or finding their old classmates, while they are simply looking up how to cook spaghetti. In fact, you don't have to come to them at all. You can have them come to you and have fun, providing potential for your ads to go viral.</h1>
		<h3>Let us introduce you to the stars of Commercial.ize! First and foremost, there's YOU. You are a great business, whether startup or Fortune 500, seeking to connect to the world in new ways during this Digital Age. And there are Posters, namely, ordinary citizens who can join Commercial.ize at any time and post videos to the site.</h3>
		<h4>Commercial.ize is the perfect venue for you to host a 'Create your own commercial' contest for your fans. You create the contest instructions, and Posters (ordinary citizens, remember?) will begin to post their own videos depicting commercial advertisements for your company. Your contest instructions can be general, such as "Make an original and creative commercial about my company." Or, you can be specific, such as by providing a an actual transcript of the commercial, and the Posters must create a video commercial that (mostly) follows the transcript.</h4>
		<h5>These commercials are available for the whole world to see. Even if a visitor doesn't post, he or she can vote on the commercials, and view the most popular ones.</h5><br />
		<p>When the contest is over, you can select the winner (based on whatever criteria you prefer, it doesn't need to be based on visitors' votes) and the winner will receive whatever prize is indicated in your instructions. Remember, the better the prize, the more video posts you'll probably get!</p><br />
		 <h2>It is so easy to begin, and you can hardly mess up, because there is only one button on this page. And it says 'BEGIN'. Once you click on it, you will be able to enter the contest directions. Once you submit, the contest is live and open to all! Let the fun begin!</h2>
