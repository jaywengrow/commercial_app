Notes describing model for Commercial.ize

There should be a standard user model, although there should be 3 types of users:
1) Businesses
2) Posters
3) Admin

Business (users) have many "Commercials"
Posters have many "Posts"
Commercials also have many "Posts"
so Posts belongs to both Posters and Businesses.
A Business can have many Posts through commercials.
