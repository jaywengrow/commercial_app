		<h1>You don't have to be annyoing to advertise on the Internet. You don't have to bombard regular denizens of the World Wide Web with annoying flashing banners about credit scores or finding their old classmates, while they are simply looking up how to cook spaghetti. In fact, you don't have to come to them at all. You can have them come to you and have fun, providing potential for your ads to go viral.</h1>
		<h4>Let us introduce you to the stars of Commercialize! First and foremost, there's YOU. You are a great business, whether startup or Fortune 500, seeking to connect to the world in new ways during the Internet Age. And there are Posters, namely, ordinary citizens who can join Commercialize at any time and post videos to the site.</h4>
		<h4>Commercialize is the perfect venue for you to host a 'Create your own commercial' contest for your fans. You create the contest instructions, and Posters (ordinary citizens, remember?) will begin to post their own videos depicting commercial advertisements for your company. Your contest instructions can be general, such as "Make an original and creative commercial about my company." Or, you can be specific, such as by providing an actual transcript of the commercial, and the Posters must create a video commercial that (mostly) follows the transcript.</h4>
		<h4>These commercials are available for the whole world to see. Even if a visitor doesn't post, he or she can vote on the commercials, and view the most popular ones.</h4>
		<h4>When the contest is over, you can select the winner (based on whatever criteria you prefer, it doesn't have to be based on visitors' votes) and the winner will receive whatever prize is indicated in your contest rules. Remember, the better the prize, the more video posts you'll probably get!</h4>
		<p>You also have complete control over the videos posted to your contest, and you can delete any that you deem inappropriate.</p>
		<p>Since we've just launched, pricing is extremely low at just $99 per month that the contest is displayed at our site.</p>
		<h4 class="red_color">But until May 31, we are offering the first month free. Take advantage of this offer you will never see again!</h4>
		<h1>It's so easy to get started. Connect with people all over the world now through your commercial contest. Let the fun begin!</h1>
