This app is called Commercialize, and it's my first Ruby on Rails project. Commercialize is a hub for 'make your own commercial contests.' Businesses launch contests, and other users post their own homemade videos of commercials for the businesses, following each contest's particular rules. Anyone can view any commercial and vote on them as well.

The app is currently deployed at http://commercialize.heroku.com
